h1. How to drive a Lampstand

Lampstand is written in Python on top of Twisted.

It currently requires MySQL and Python >= 2.8

First, catch your python, then install some kind of virtual environment system for it,
I use virtualenv & virtualenvwrapper.

Once inside your PVM, install all the required modules. In theory this is just
@pip install -f requirements.pip@ unless I've forgotten to add something.

schema.sql contains the MySQL schema for everything Lampstand desires, use it to
create a database.

defaults.ini is loaded by default, any value in config.ini overrides defaults.ini,
and is ignored from git, so put your password values there. At minimum, you'll need
to change the nickname & database auth details.
